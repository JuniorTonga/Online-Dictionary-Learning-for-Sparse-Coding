Time series project MVA. Implementation of the paper Online Dictionary Learning for Sparse Coding ( https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/pdfs/icml09.pdf)

The paper introduces an online optimization procedure for the problem of dictionary learning designed to dynamically adapt to changing data distributions. Leveraging stochastic gradient descent for incremental updates and incorporating a sparsity-inducing L1 penalty, the proposed algorithm enhances the efficiency and adaptability of sparse coding.

Experiment have been done on both image and audio parts. 

- The data for images experiments was taken here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification?resource=download&select=seg_test

- In the experiments Folder you will find the notebook of the image experiment and also signal experiments
- in the src folder you will find the source code for the experiment
- in the Dataset, you will find the data used in signal experiments
